## Environment architecture

For this assignment I will be using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon Fargate. For this, I made an ECS cluster with a task definition to run the game inside the cluster.

## Reflections

- What did you learn? As I am new to these technologies, I learned how to use Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon ECR to deploy and manage applications effectively. Working on the Tic Tac Toe project helped me understand the end-to-end process of setting up and configuring environments in AWS.
- What obstacles did you overcome? One of the main obstacles was getting familiar with the AWS services and their configurations. Setting up the Elastic Beanstalk environment correctly and ensuring the components communicated seamlessly were significant challenges. I had some problems when using the image of the front as I got some errors and had to create it from the beginning. Additionally, understanding how to deploy Docker images to Amazon ECR and reference them in a Terraform configuration was initially difficult. 
- What did you help most in overcoming obstacles? The tutorial from T6 in e-portal was really helpful in overcoming these obstacles. Also I got help from my classmates, who guided me through the process. Hands-on practice and experimentation also played a crucial role.
- Was that something that surprised you? I was surprised by how user-friendly the process of deploying applications can be with AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk and ECR. Despite the initial learning curve, the automation and integration features significantly simplified deployment and management tasks.
